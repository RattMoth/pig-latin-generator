# pig-latin-generator

Inspired by [this intermediate algorithm challenge](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/pig-latin) on FreeCodeCamp.

I've been practicing algorithms on FCC which has helped me gain a better understanding of JavaScript. However I still have little experience building websites that incorporate JavaScript functionality. This is a practice project designed to familiarize myself with mixing JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
